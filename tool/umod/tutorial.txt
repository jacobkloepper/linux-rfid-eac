For some background, Epson VDC has a set of key-fobs for electronic access.   
   These fobs hold a unique ID (UID) and a low-frequency antenna. These UIDs  
   are read by the readers outside each door, and are used to physically      
   unlock the doors. An auxiliary chip placed onto each fob contains a        
   separate UID and a high-frequency antenna. These UIDs are used to track    
   worker entrances and exits.                                                
                                                                              
   Because the two antennae are tuned to different frequencies, there is no   
   intereference between the two. Essentially, there are two independent      
   systems to accomplish two different goals, but relying on the same         
   technology and contained within one physical package.                      
                                                                              
This tutorial is concerned only with the UIDs on the auxiliary chips, and     
   therefore is concerned only with the worker in/out system.                 
                                                                              
The UIDs are seven bytes long. Each byte encodes two hexadecimal numbers      
   (0-F) and therefore each UID can be represented as a string of             
   fourteen characters, each being a number 0-9 or a letter A-F.              
   For example, one such ID is "040f277aa17081".                              
                                                                              
The following set of paragraphs are only relevant if the system is changed    
   and new RFID tags are bought.                                              
                                                                              
   The length of the UID is determined by the physical component chosen.      
   Should this component change, the lower-level software can                 
   accommodate a UID of a different length, but some precautions must         
   be taken.                                                                  
                                                                              
   Most importantly is the chance of collisions. Comparing the total set of   
   possible UIDs of two different lengths, there are pairs that "look"        
   equal depending on the reading system. For a contrived example, consider   
   three- and four-byte UIDs "1a3" and "1a32". If looking at the first three  
   characters, they are the same. Further, we have "1a33," "1a34", and so on. 
                                                                              
   Note that, in general, the odds of collisions occuring at seven-byte       
   resolutions are extremely low. However, RFID tag manufacturers order       
   their tags in groups. For example, the string "7aa17081" is found in the   
   latter half of three keys owned as of writing this.                        
                                                                               
   Essentially, simply check to make sure that nobody's UIDs are the same.    
                                                                              
   If manually entering UIDs, if the new UID is shorter than seven bytes,     
   then the worker's ID must be right-padded with zeroes. For example,        
   a four-byte UID would be entered as "a553c423000000".                      
                                                                              
The script called below, umodx.py, asks you to input a user's name followed   
   by scanning their fob. The script will update the system's data file to    
   pair the UID with the name.
